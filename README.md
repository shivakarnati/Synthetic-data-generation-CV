## About the Project

This project is a **Synthetic Expression Classifier** that leverages synthetic image data generated with Stable Diffusion to train a Random Forest Classifier for recognizing facial expressions. The trained model is then deployed using a simple **PyGame interface** that allows users to test the classifier on new images.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Generation with Stable Diffusion

The project starts by generating synthetic images using **Stable Diffusion**, a powerful image synthesis model, to create diverse facial expressions. These images are crucial for training an accurate classifier without needing a large, labeled dataset.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

Once the synthetic data is generated, it undergoes preprocessing. This step includes:

- **Resizing and normalizing images** to standardize input data.
- **Data augmentation** to improve model generalization.
- **Label encoding** to prepare labels for supervised training.

### 3. Model Training

The preprocessed data is fed into a **Random Forest Classifier** implemented using Scikit-Learn. This model is trained to recognize different expressions in the synthetic data. Key aspects of this step:

- Feature extraction from images.
- Training and tuning the model using Scikit-Learn.
- Evaluating model accuracy and performance metrics.

### 4. PyGame Integration

Once trained, the model is deployed in a PyGame interface, allowing users to test its accuracy interactively.

- **Interactive GUI** to display predictions in real-time.
- **User-friendly controls** to load new images and see classifier predictions.
- **Model integration** with PyGame for seamless interaction.
